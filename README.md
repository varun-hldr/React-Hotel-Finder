## Here is my complete Introduction about the App

#### Admin Details
Admin: {
      name: "Admin",
      email: "varun@123",
      password: "12345",
    },

#### Talking about the Structure:

I have Create a beautiful Navbar  where user can find link to the booking page, Once a user book a Hotel the app automatically redirects to the booking page where user can all see their booking histories

#####   These are the Booking Details:

- UserName 
- HotelName
- Starting Date
- Ending Date
- Status

On the Booking page Non-Admin User can only view their bookings.

I have created separate features for Admin User, Admin user can see, all the booking mark their status also I have created separate Dashboard for Admin user.

User can book hotels as many as he wants and all the bookings can be view at the view-booking page which both Admin and Non-Admin user can see.

#### Talking about the Signup Form

I have created a Minimal Pop-UP Signup for where user have can create their account and login to, I have also marked all the validation for signup and as I mention above I have used Session Storage to User Data. So if you sign up to the App your data will be available until the session is not expired.

For the Admin details I have kept all admin data hard coded in the App.js file which you can change according to your need. 

If a user successfully login a welcome text will be shown in the right side of the Navbar, and booking is only possible if the user is logged in, I have created separate logic for this also.

#### Talking about other features

User can search hotels by city, and filter hotels by pricing, A beautiful card view list of hotels will appear where user can view some details about the hotel before booking. 

I want to add more features on it but due to lack of time I was not able to, but I will work on this app and add more features also make it more easier to understand by any user.
